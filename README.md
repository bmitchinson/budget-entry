## ðŸ’¸ Budget Entry

A digital checkbook app designed for fast mobile data entry.
Built with SvelteKit and capacitor.

As soon as the app is open, you're given a keypad for price entry while on
the go. Categorization and a line item title as well.

## Why

YNAB and Mint use "Plaid" to connect to bank accounts
and parse / categorize automatically, but I'd rather manage the data more simply
and on my own away from Intuit. Plus, plaid doesn't connect to my bank.
