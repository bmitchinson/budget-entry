## ðŸ’¸ Budget Entry

A digital checkbook app designed for fast mobile data entry.
Built with SvelteKit and Capacitor.

Immediately on app launch you're given a keypad for price entry + quick
categorization.

## Why

Don't give up your all your financial data just to see a inaccurate
auto-generated categorization table.
